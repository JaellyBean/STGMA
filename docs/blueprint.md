## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Charcoal (#262626): A deep, off-black. It's softer than pure black and feels modern, strong, and serious. It represents the foundation and strength.
- Background color: Bone White (#F9F6F2): A warm, soft white. It's calming, clean, and hopeful, representing a blank page and a new start.
- Secondary color: Heather Grey (#B2B2B2): The classic color of comfort, directly referencing the iconic hoodie. It’s neutral, approachable, and timeless.
- Accent color: Muted Gold (#C1A574): This color represents hope and resilience. It's inspired by Kintsugi—the art of repairing broken pottery with gold. It’s premium, warm, and optimistic without being loud.
- Secondary Accent color: Sage Green (#8A9A8C): This color represents growth and mental clarity. It's a calm, natural, and soothing tone that is widely associated with wellness but is subdued enough for a streetwear brand.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, suitable for body text
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif for headings.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent different mental health resources and topics.
